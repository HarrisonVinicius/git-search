# github-search

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate

# run unit tests
$ yarn test
# ATENTION!
# it may be necessary to run the command yarn add -D @ nuxt / babel-preset-app to run the unit tests
# due to lack of development time this application has little coverage of unit tests at the moment
# PS the watcher for unit test is disabled

# some improvements need to be implemented in the application such as error handling in the search for user or e2e tests
# the TDD methodology was not used in the implementation of this application
# the BEM CSS methodology was used in this project
# this application makes use of the atomic design implementation
```
